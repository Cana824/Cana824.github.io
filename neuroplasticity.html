    <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <h3>
      Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
      people.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is important for people to understand. They would be able
      to innately understand the fact that things are difficult solely because
      you have <span class="bold">YET</span> to fully understand the topic. New
      synapses are being built as an individual attempts to learn something new.
      <br />
      In the health care system, neuroplasticity is important particularly for
      stroke patients. Whilst having damaged neurons, neuroplasticity enables
      them to rewire and create new neural pathways to recover lost functions.
      This allows them to improve their quality of life. Thus, understanding the
      principles of neuroplasticity is beneficial, as it can be applied in many
      aspects of learning.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
      your benefit
    </h3>
    <p>
      Personally, I will apply neuroplasticity alongside each sprint. By knowing
      that learning is a process and that improvement and understanding is a
      curve. I should challenge myself with what I do not understand to create
      the new neuron pathways to develop myself. Utilising the acronym from the
      psychologist Carol Dewick - <span class="bold">A.G.E.S</span>, I can
      ensure <span class="bold">A</span>ttention is adequate whilst tackling
      sprints, <span class="bold">G</span>eneration by associating various known
      knowledge to what I am currently learning, <span class="bold">E</span> by
      adding in how I feel in the moment, and <span class="bold">S</span>pacing
      new knowledge apart so I have sufficient time to process knowledge and
      also have several opportunities to return the topic.
    </p>
    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      From a medical understanding neuroplasticity - things such a challenging
      self with new things like music or skills, decreasing stress, regular
      exercise, and quality sleep all can increase neuroplasticity. <br />
      For myself, I believe that I need to ensure that I reduce my stressors and
      sleep an appropriate number of hours to boost my neuroplasticity.
      According to M. Puderbaugh ad P. Emmady 2023, “reducing stress and
      avoiding sleep deprivation have been shown to be helpful to improve
      memory, attention span, and other domains of cognition”. I am happy about
      my level of physical activity and the DevAcademy course is a huge
      challenge.

    <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
    <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
    <p>
      Growth mindset is the belief that growth can be developed through applying
      self and dedication. Growth mindset is relevant in DevAcademy and in life
      as it embraces the fact that mistakes and flaws are not dead ends, it is
      an opportunity moment to learn. Challenges are positive situations where
      new things can be realised. Thus, to succeed in study and in life, a
      growth mindset is beneficial.
    </p>
    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst exploring neuroplasticity and growth mindsets, I was surprised that
      whilst I actively said things such as “I love challenges”, I will also
      quickly say things like “this is too hard”. I firmly believe that by
      resetting myself in the situation of wanting to give up, I would be able
      to improve myself at a better rate. I will aspire to change myself to not
      give up and try for 5 extra minutes when hitting hurdles whilst still
      knowing when to ask for help.
    </p>
    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>
      To integrate growth mindset into your learning journey, I will actively
      seek challenges and apply mindfulness and add 'YET' for when I am
      struggling. I aim to have more patience with myself and show more kindness
      in the journey.

    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
    <h3>
      Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
      learning plan and strategy.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Understanding neuroplasticity and growth mindset has given me a clearer
      direction for shaping my learning plan. Knowing that my brain can form new
      pathways helps me reframe challenges as part of the learning process
      rather than as obstacles. This means I will intentionally design my study
      strategy around practice, repetition, and persistence, allowing myself to
      sit with discomfort when something feels difficult, because that is when
      growth is happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, adopting a growth mindset will help me manage setbacks
      more productively. Instead of seeing mistakes as failures, I will treat
      them as feedback loops- pointing me toward what I need to strengthen
      understanding of. To put this into practice, I will add the word “yet” to
      moments of struggle (e.g., “I don't understand this yet”), which will help
      me stay motivated and maintain patience with myself.
    </p>
    <p>Together, these principles will shape my learning plan by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        • Building in spaced repetition to strengthen memory (neuroplasticity
        principle).
      </li>
      <li>
        • Creating a routine that balances focus, rest, and reflection, so I can
        process and integrate new knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>
        • Actively seeking challenging tasks rather than avoiding them, using
        them as opportunities for growth.
      </li>
      <li>
        • Practising self-kindness and resilience when I hit hurdles, leaning on
        the growth mindset to persist.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ultimately, these understandings encourage me to view my learning journey
      as dynamic and evolving. With neuroplasticity, I know my brain can adapt;
      with a growth mindset, I know I can guide that adaptation through effort
      and perseverance. This combined approach gives me a stronger, more
      sustainable strategy for progressing in DevAcademy and beyond.
