    <h1>BootCamp Learning Plan</h1>

    <h3>My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
    <p>
      As I progress from Foundations into Bootcamp, I have reflected on my
      goals, strenths and challenges that I will face. I write this learning
      plan as a commitment to how I will approach the next stage of my
      DevAcademy learning and how I will see myself grow technically and
      personally.
    </p>

    <h3>My long-term goals</h3>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to transition out of the healthcare field and into
      the IT industry. This will be a significant shift from my last 8 years as
      a Medical Laboratory Scientist, but is what I look forward to. IT
      interests me as it constantly evolves, there are many opportunities to
      problem solve and allows me to continuously learn throughout my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I graduate from DevAcademy, I hope to transition into a developer
      role where I can apply both analytical skills from my Science background
      and new technical knowledge I can get with DevAcademy. Beyond just getting
      a job, I want to show others that a big career change is possible with
      dedication.
    </p>

    <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      One of my greatest strengths is my curiosity. I enjoy being very hands on
      with something that interests me. When the initial spark of curiosity
      fades, I have the discipline and maturity to continue moving forward. I am
      also analytical and am able to prioritise effectively which comes with the
      maturity I have gained in my early 30s.
    </p>
    <p>
      My limitations are also important to recognise. Balancing part-time study
      with full-time shift work is a big challenge, and I find myself holding
      myself (and others) to very high expectations, which can be stressful.
      Through Foundations, I have also realised that I can work things out on my
      own (with a lot of googling). While persistence is useful, it can also
      slow me down due to my own stubbornes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These strengths and limitations will shape my Bootcamp experience. My
      curiousity and adaptability will help me embrance challenges, which my
      high standards and hesitation to ask for help are things I need to manage
      carefully.
    </p>

    <h3>Non-Technical Challenges ahead</h3>
    <p>
      I am expecting my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be
      working in groups and learning to trust others. Past experiences have made
      me wary of relying too heavily on the team, and I know that collaboration
      is a key element of Bootcamp. Thus, letting go of perfectionism and
      embracing different ways of working will be essential for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also anticipate that the intensity of the next 12 weeks will test my
      energy and motivation. I know that staying consistent, pacing myself and
      maintaining balance will be just as important as writing code.
    </p>

    <h3>Human SKills I want to develop</h3>
    <p>
      During DevAcademy, I want to grow in the areaas of communication,
      teamwork, and emotional intelligence. I want to learn how to give and
      receive constructive feedback, improve how I collaborate with different
      personalities, and develop my confidenc ein speaking up and sharing ideas.
      I also want to work on my resilience and self-awareness so I can manage my
      expectations of myself and others more effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      These skills will support my throughout Bootcamp and will help me work
      better as a team player.
    </p>

    <h3>Expectations of the DevAcademy Team and Myself</h3>
    <p>
      I still expect guidance, encouragement, and feedback from the
      DevAcademyteam to help me find my own answers than to give answers
      directly. For me, support looks like approachable facilitators, who are
      open to questions and a safe environment where it is okay to make
      mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From myself, I expect commitment and perseverance. I will proactively
      manage my time, and be repectful and honest with challenges and how I work
      in a group. I will ensure that I contribute and make sure I ask questions
      and help when I need to.
    </p>

    <h3>Seeking Help and Managing workload</h3>
    <p>
      To avoid staying stuck for too long, I will look over my code
      systematically, check for resources to guide me, reach out to others,
      facilitators or my partner. Additionally, when I find myself too
      frustrated to progress and am not learning, I will take a short break to
      give me the clarity I need.
    </p>
    <p>
      To manage my workload, I will use the timeboxes as a guide, plan my shift
      schedule in advance, and communicate early if I start to feel overwhelmed.
      I will take care of my wellbeing - physical and mental so I can show up
      fully. I will work productively and respectfullywith my peers,
      facilitators by being clear, kind and professional.
    </p>

    <p class="analogy">
      In summary: Bootcamp will be a challenge. It is not solely about learning
      code, but also about building resilience, trust, and collaboration. My
      goal is to successfully graduate with the technical and human skills
      required to become a good developer and beyond.
    </p>

    <h1>Formulate Learning Plan</h1>

    <h3>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to shift my career into IT or IT related work. I have
      worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist for 8 years so it will be a
      drastic change. My long-term goal is to transition my career into IT or
      IT-related work. Having worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist for eight
      years, this will be a significant career change. I am motivated by the
      opportunities in IT to continually learn, solve problems creatively, and
      work in an evolving field. Ultimately, I aim to secure a role that allows
      me to apply both my analytical skills from science and my new technical
      skills in IT.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am a person who is curious and willing to delve into what I do not know
      or fully understand. Luckily with a splash of discipline I can continue
      learning after the initial feeling of curiosity disappears. Time is also
      limited, as a person who works full time and does shift work, it gets
      difficult to ensure I have sufficient time allocated to study.
      Additionally, there is a deep fear that I cannot meet my own expectations
      and end up not utilizing what I learn from dev academy outside of it.
      Maturity has set into my early 30s as someone who now knows what and how
      to prioritize to get things moving forward. I am naturally curious and
      willing to explore unfamiliar concepts in depth. Once my curiosity is
      sparked, I can maintain my learning momentum with discipline and
      perseverance. Time management is a key limitation — working full-time
      shifts can make it challenging to allocate consistent study hours.
      Additionally, I sometimes fear that I may not meet my own high standards
      or might struggle to apply what I learn beyond the Dev Academy
      environment. However, in my early 30s, I have developed a strong sense of
      prioritisation, enabling me to focus on what truly matters and move
      forward with determination.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I would like to see myself working together with groups of people. I have
      trouble trusting others in groups as I have been let down and disappointed
      many times by team members. I would like to be able to trust and accept
      other's work outside the realms of my own high expectations. This may be
      ways such as me improving communication, setting better
      boundaries/expectations and working on my emotional intelligence. While at
      Dev Academy, I want to strengthen my ability to collaborate effectively in
      groups. In the past, I have found it challenging to fully trust teammates
      due to experiences of being let down. My aim is to learn to trust and
      value others' contributions, even if their approach differs from my own
      high expectations. To achieve this, I will focus on improving my
      communication, setting clear boundaries and expectations, and developing
      my emotional intelligence so I can work constructively and respectfully
      with a variety of personalities.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      This should include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </li>
        <li>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I will manage my workload by allocating time to studying suggested by the
      timeboxes. These are a good indicator of how much time needs to go into
      each section. Additionally, as a shift worker, I will asses my work hours
      and if it I feel overwhelmed, I will ask the facilitators for aid, get
      support from my family and take time away from my job to ensure I can
      dedicate enough time into learning. I will follow the suggested timeboxes
      as a guide for how much time to invest in each section of study. As a
      shift worker, I will review my work schedule weekly to plan study sessions
      that fit well around my roster. If I start to feel overwhelmed, I will:
    </p>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Communicate early with facilitators to discuss strategies or
          adjustments.
        </li>
        <li>Seek support from my partner and family.</li>
        <li>Take short breaks to reset my focus.</li>
        <li>
          Consider reducing my work hours temporarily if necessary to maintain
          balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will also work productively and respectfully with other learners,
          facilitators, and community members by being proactive in
          communication, open to feedback, and mindful of group dynamics.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>
      5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h3>
    <p>
      If I am stuck I will ask the facilitators, my partner (works in IT) and
      also review my own work systematically so I am not stuck for too long.
      Sometimes taking a break will also help me see clearer afterwards. If I am
      stuck, I will:
    </p>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First review my work systematically to check for overlooked solutions.
        </li>
        <li>Consult course resources and notes.</li>
        <li>Reach out to facilitators or peers for guidance.</li>
        <li>
          Discuss challenges with my partner, who works in IT. I will avoid
          staying “stuck” for too long by setting a time limit before seeking
          help. I also recognise that taking short breaks can bring a fresh
          perspective.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect approachable people whos aim it is to help us achieve and
      understand. I would prefer facilitators to guide me to the answers rather
      than outright giving them out. I expect facilitators to be approachable,
      encouraging, and committed to helping us achieve both understanding and
      confidence in our skills. I value guidance that helps me find answers
      independently rather than being given direct solutions, as this deepens
      learning.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
      committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments
      like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have a 3 week trip planned at the end of December to mid January, I
      planned this trip around the dev academy breaks. For work, as I do
      rotating shifts - I will require weekly adjustment of study schedule.
