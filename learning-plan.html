    <h1>Formulate Learning Plan</h1>

    <h3>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to shift my career into IT or IT related work. I have
      worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist for 8 years so it will be a
      drastic change. My long-term goal is to transition my career into IT or
      IT-related work. Having worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist for eight
      years, this will be a significant career change. I am motivated by the
      opportunities in IT to continually learn, solve problems creatively, and
      work in an evolving field. Ultimately, I aim to secure a role that allows
      me to apply both my analytical skills from science and my new technical
      skills in IT.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am a person who is curious and willing to delve into what I do not know
      or fully understand. Luckily with a splash of discipline I can continue
      learning after the initial feeling of curiosity disappears. Time is also
      limited, as a person who works full time and does shift work, it gets
      difficult to ensure I have sufficient time allocated to study.
      Additionally, there is a deep fear that I cannot meet my own expectations
      and end up not utilizing what I learn from dev academy outside of it.
      Maturity has set into my early 30s as someone who now knows what and how
      to prioritize to get things moving forward. I am naturally curious and
      willing to explore unfamiliar concepts in depth. Once my curiosity is
      sparked, I can maintain my learning momentum with discipline and
      perseverance. Time management is a key limitation — working full-time
      shifts can make it challenging to allocate consistent study hours.
      Additionally, I sometimes fear that I may not meet my own high standards
      or might struggle to apply what I learn beyond the Dev Academy
      environment. However, in my early 30s, I have developed a strong sense of
      prioritisation, enabling me to focus on what truly matters and move
      forward with determination.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I would like to see myself working together with groups of people. I have
      trouble trusting others in groups as I have been let down and disappointed
      many times by team members. I would like to be able to trust and accept
      other's work outside the realms of my own high expectations. This may be
      ways such as me improving communication, setting better
      boundaries/expectations and working on my emotional intelligence. While at
      Dev Academy, I want to strengthen my ability to collaborate effectively in
      groups. In the past, I have found it challenging to fully trust teammates
      due to experiences of being let down. My aim is to learn to trust and
      value others' contributions, even if their approach differs from my own
      high expectations. To achieve this, I will focus on improving my
      communication, setting clear boundaries and expectations, and developing
      my emotional intelligence so I can work constructively and respectfully
      with a variety of personalities.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      This should include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </li>
        <li>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I will manage my workload by allocating time to studying suggested by the
      timeboxes. These are a good indicator of how much time needs to go into
      each section. Additionally, as a shift worker, I will asses my work hours
      and if it I feel overwhelmed, I will ask the facilitators for aid, get
      support from my family and take time away from my job to ensure I can
      dedicate enough time into learning. I will follow the suggested timeboxes
      as a guide for how much time to invest in each section of study. As a
      shift worker, I will review my work schedule weekly to plan study sessions
      that fit well around my roster. If I start to feel overwhelmed, I will:
    </p>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Communicate early with facilitators to discuss strategies or
          adjustments.
        </li>
        <li>Seek support from my partner and family.</li>
        <li>Take short breaks to reset my focus.</li>
        <li>
          Consider reducing my work hours temporarily if necessary to maintain
          balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will also work productively and respectfully with other learners,
          facilitators, and community members by being proactive in
          communication, open to feedback, and mindful of group dynamics.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>
      5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h3>
    <p>
      If I am stuck I will ask the facilitators, my partner (works in IT) and
      also review my own work systematically so I am not stuck for too long.
      Sometimes taking a break will also help me see clearer afterwards. If I am
      stuck, I will: 
    <div>
       <ol>
        <li> First review my work systematically to check for
      overlooked solutions. </li>
        <li>Consult course resources and notes. </li>
        <li>Reach out
      to facilitators or peers for guidance. </li>
        <li>Discuss challenges with my
      partner, who works in IT. I will avoid staying “stuck” for too long by
      setting a time limit before seeking help. I also recognise that taking
      short breaks can bring a fresh perspective.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    </p>
    <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect approachable people whos aim it is to help us achieve and
      understand. I would prefer facilitators to guide me to the answers rather
      than outright giving them out. I expect facilitators to be approachable,
      encouraging, and committed to helping us achieve both understanding and
      confidence in our skills. I value guidance that helps me find answers
      independently rather than being given direct solutions, as this deepens
      learning.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
      committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments
      like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have a 3 week trip planned at the end of December to mid January, I
      planned this trip around the dev academy breaks. For work, as I do rotating shifts - I 
      will require weekly adjustment of study schedule.
