    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>1. I don't know myself as much as I thought.</p>
    <p>
      2. I learnt that I doubt myself more than I realise, especially in
      situations where I feel unprepared. My ego gets in the way of asking for
      help. Thus, now I've realised that it is important to be more vulnerable
      to strengthen learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. EQ and IQ are just as important as one another. They come hand in hand
      in creating the person you are.

    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p>
      My values help keep me grounded in how I work with other people. Empathy
      enables me to collaborate effectively with other people. In programming,
      it is an essential skill to have as it requires a lot of collaborative
      problem solving. Self-awareness will allow me to recognise my own
      limitations and ask for support when I need it - all essential in learning
      and professional development.
    </p>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I was surprised at the amount of self-reflection human skills learning
      involved. It is helping me become more self-aware, improving my
      communication and impacting how I approach working with others.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      THe most challenging part was being open and vulnerable. Acknowledging my
      flaws and ego is eye opening. Another challenge is slowing down and deeply
      reflecting. This is because it was an aspect that I did not realise how
      much I didn't know about myself.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I believe that it is an imporatnt skillset to have. An individual who is
      able to have these skills are likely more capable of open communication,
      being more vulnerable and open to feedback, thus, are better team players.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time?Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Human Skills learning is not a waste of time. While practicing programming
      is also vital, without having human skills, programming knowledge will not
      take me far career-wise. Rather it is EQ. These sessions allowed me to see
      myself differently and acknowledge my own limitations. Also, I know that I
      can build resilience and improve, thus makes me a better programmer. Human
      skills is lifelong and in every aspect of my life, not just for codidng.
