      The  <span class="id-selector">id</span> and  <span class="class-selector">class</span> attributes in HTML are both used to label elements, allowing CSS to target and style them. While they serve a similar purpose, there are <span class="underline">key differences</span> between them.
    </p></div>
<div id="box-container">
  
  
  <div>
    <p id="p1">
      Unique: The id attribute is unique - there is only one element on a page should have a given id. This is useful when you want to target a single, specific element. For example, a unique page title or header that has its own special styling. 
      <br>In CSS syntax: A class selector is written with a . (e.g., .button)</br>
      <br>id has a higher precendence in CSS as it has a high specificity</br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p id="p2">
      Reusable: The class attribute, on the other hand, is reusable and can be applied to multiple elements. This makes it ideal for styling a group of elements that share a common design  like all the buttons on a page, and images.
      <br>In CSS syntax: An id selector is written with a # (e.g., #header)</br>
      <br>class has a lower priority compared to CSS so the id selector attributes will take effect</br>
    </p>
  </div>

  A helpful analogy: imagine many Toyota Corollas -they all share the same make and model. If you wanted to style all Toyota Corollas, you'd use a class like ".corolla". But if you want to style your specific Corolla, you'd use an id like "#my-car", because there's only one.
