    <h1>Intelligence Quotient vs Emotional Quotient</h1>
    <p>
      Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measurement of a person's cognitive
      abilities to problem-solve, reason and process information. It is usually
      assessed using standardised tests to evaluate skills. Essentially the
      higher the IQ means higher analytical thinking, quicker learning and the
      ability to apply the knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emotional Quotient (EQ) is how well a person can 'read the room', that is
      to recognise, understand and manage emotions of their own and others.
      Skills such as empathy, self-awareness, self-regulation and social skills
      are key in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      IQ can give you an advantage in technical and analytical work, but EQ can
      be the driving factor in long-term success. EQ is important for
      leadership, teamwork, conflict resolution and personal well-being.
