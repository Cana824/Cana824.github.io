    <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
    <h2>Your Blog</h2>

    <h3>
      Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Created html and css, then linked them together to create my new blog.
    </p>
    <h3>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</h3>
    <p>
      Working with the time boxes is a good indicator of how much time I should
      spend on each section. Keeping within the suggested timeframe seems to be
      working well but there have been instances where I've gotten distracted
      and thus over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Learn HTML and CSS</h2>

    <h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>
    <p>
      I found the amount of options alittle overwhelming when going through the
      html, css, and media learning. I coped with this with additional videos on
      youtube to help understand various parts. I also attempted extra html CSS
      learning by looking at simple designs and replicating it in terminal/html.
    </p>
    <h3>What are you proud of from this challenge?</h3>
    <p>
      I am proud that I did not give up. It took alot of effort and breaks to
      make sure I was in a learning mood but I got through the challenge.
      Additionally, I kept reenforcing the fact that everything I am learning is
      novel to me - it will take me time, I just don't know how to do it YET -
      but I will try.
    </p>

    <h2>DevTools Tutorial</h2>
    <h3>
      What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations
      when doing this crash course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I learn best with visual cues and step-by-step instructions. Although I
      work at a slower pace, this helps improve my memory and understanding.
      I've noticed I retain information better when I can see and apply it in
      real time.
    </p>
    <h3>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</h3>
    <p>
      I got stuck with the new concepts and attempting to read the html code on
      browsers to manipulate. I had to review the videos provided and also look
      at external resoures to increase understanding.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the
      ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have 18 tabs open - 13 is study related, 5 is not. 13:5 ratio is not too
      terrible but definitely can cut down on irrelevant tabs.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name
      into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.
    </h3>
    <p>Done</p>

    <h2>Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h2>
    <h3>
      Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could
      personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story
      should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      HTML is a builder - building up structures like walls, doors, frames and
      roofs. HTML lays the foundation of the working element before CSS - a
      designer can beautify everything. CSS changes color, make interactive
      elements which completes the build. CSS cannot exist without HTML
      constructing the base of which CSS can act upon- therefore a collaborative
      relationship.
    </p>

    <h3>Any moments of surprise or joy?</h3>
    <p>
      While learning CSS, I found a really useful shortcut using selectors like
      #album > img and body > *. Instead of styling each element one-by-one, I
      could write a single line of code to apply styles to multiple elements at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:

      <br />#album > img means “select all elements that are direct children of
      the element with id=album.” It ignores any images that are nested deeper
      inside other tags. I used this to CSS code all images within my id=album
      for the photos I added onto my blog.<br />

      body > * means “select all elements that are direct children of the .” The
      * is the universal selector—it represents any element, no matter the tag
      (like div, h1, section, etc.). I wanted to remove the weird spacing on the
      edges of the site so I made the body margin = 0px. However, this also
      caused all the words to start from the edge. To resolve this, I added
      padding using the above body > *. Thus, instead of writing code
      individually for each body element - I used the body > * coding to refer
      to all children within the body element.
    </p>
    <h3>
      If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be?
      Why?
    </h3>
    <p>
      If HTML and CSS were animals I would say they are Bowerbirds. CSS would be
      the male bowerbirds-they build nests that are pretty. These are decorated
      with colourful things like berries and flowers to attract mates.It’s all
      about appearance and style - just like CSS focuses on making web content
      visually appealing. HTML, on the other hand, would be the female
      bowerbird. She builds the actual functional nest- a soft, saucer-shaped
      structure high above the ground where she lays eggs. This is similar to
      how HTML creates the structure and content of a webpage. Both male and
      female bowerbirds are involved in nest-building, just in different,
      complementary ways-just like HTML and CSS work together to build websites.
      One creates the structure, and the other adds beauty and visual design.
