      Analogy: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript body analogy HTML is like a human
      skeleton and body structure - head, body, arms, legs CSS is like putting
      make up and pretty clothes on the body Javascript is the brain component
      which controls the actions of the body So in the context of a website -
      HTML is the structure, CSS is the makeup and clothes and JavaScript is the
      actionables of the website. Control Flow and Loops: Laundry 1. Wash
      clothes 2. Hang wet clothes 3. Allow clothes to dry 4. Take dry clothes
      off the line 5. Fold clothes 6. Put away clothes Control Flow is the order
      of which instructions occur - this is usually from top down. A loop can be
      incorporated into this process so that you don't have to write full code
      for every single item. Instead we can use a loop: // Clothing into an
      array let clothes = [“shirt”,”pants”,”jacket”,”shorts”,”towel”,”socks”];
      //Fold clothes until no more clothes for(let i = 0; i <= clothes.length; i
      ++) { console.log(“Folded” +clothes[i]); } The output: Folded shirt,
      Folded pants Folded jacket Folded shorts Folded towel Folded socks
