    <p>
      Analogy: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript body analogy HTML is like a human
      skeleton and body structure - head, body, arms, legs CSS is like putting
      make up and pretty clothes on the body
    </p>
    <p>
      Javascript is the brain component which controls the actions of the body
      So in the context of a website - HTML is the structure, CSS is the makeup
      and clothes and JavaScript is the actionables of the website.

    <p>Control Flow and Loops: Laundry</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1. Wash clothes</li>
      <li>2. Hang wet clothes</li>
      <li>3. Allow clothes to dry</li>
      <li>4. Take dry clothes off the line</li>
      <li>5. Fold clothes</li>
      <li>6. Put away clothes</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- </p> -->
    <p>
      Control Flow is the order of which instructions occur - this is usually
      from top down. A loop can be incorporated into this process so that you
      don't have to write full code for every single item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead we can use a loop:<br />
      // Clothing into an array <br />
      let clothes = [“shirt”,”pants”,”jacket”,”shorts”,”towel”,”socks”];
      <br />//Fold clothes until no more clothes <br />
      for(let i = 0; i &lt;= clothes.length; i ++) { <br />
      console.log(“Folded” +clothes[i]); }
    </p>
    <p>The output:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Folded shirt,</li>
      <li>Folded pants</li>
      <li>Folded jacket</li>
      <li>Folded shorts</li>
      <li>Folded towel</li>
      <li>Folded socks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DOM (Document Object Model)</h2>
    <p>
      This is how JavaScript sees the webpage. It is like a tree - branching
      into various elements of headings, paragraphs, buttons, and more of which
      can be interacted with.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the example above, DOM elements can be added to the code so that it
      can be interacted with.
    </p>
    Example: Laundry
    <button id="foldButton">Fold Next Item</button>
    <p id="status"></p>

    <pre><code>
    // Clothes in an array
    let clothes = ["shirt", "pants", "jacket", "shorts", "towel", "socks"];

    // DOM elements
    let status = document.getElementById("status");
    let foldButton = document.getElementById("foldButton");

    // Keep track of which item we’re folding
    let currentIndex = i;

    // Button click event
    foldButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
      if (i < clothes.length) {
        // Update the text inside the <p>
        status.textContent = "Folded " + clothes[i];
        i++;
      } else {
        // When all clothes are folded
        status.textContent = "All clothes are folded!";
        foldButton.disabled = true;
      }
    });
</code></pre>
    Arrays and Objects are similar by the way it stores data, but they are
    utilised differently. An array is what was used above, it starts from 0.
    <pre><code>
let clothes = ["shirt", "pants", "jacket", "shorts", "towel", "socks"];
</code></pre>
    There are 6 items, the list range in order from 0-5. Arrays are utilised
    when the order of the items matters such as a list of items or a to-do list.
    Objects are used to describe something such as an individual
    <pre><code>
const customer = {
	Name = “Lily”
	gender = “Female”
	age = “30”
	Occupation = “Teacher”
}
</code></pre>
    Functions are useful as repetitive instructions of code. Functions enable
    you to write code just once and can be utilised repetitively. Thus with our
    laundry example: We can write
    <pre><code>
function foldClothes(clothes){
console.log(“Folded” + clothes);
}

</code></pre>
    Which will output Folded shirt, Folded pants Folded jacket Folded shorts
    Folded towel Folded socks
