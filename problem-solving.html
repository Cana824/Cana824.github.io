      <h3>Problem Solving:</h3>
      <p>
        is a vital skill for overcoming challenges and an important ability for
        every developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the journey in Web Development, it is essential to build
        techniques to help you approach and tackle problems effectively.
      </p>
      <p>There are various techniques such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
        <li>Trying something</li>
        <li>Rubber Ducky method</li>
        <li>Reading Error Messages</li>
        <li>Console.logging</li>
        <li>Googling</li>
        <li>Asking Peers</li>
        <li>Asking Coaches</li>
        <li>Reflection</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 6/10</i></p>
      <p>
        Breaking code into written steps helps turn big problems into smaller,
        easier pieces. Writing everything out makes it easier to see the
        process, move steps around, or add and remove things when needed. Laying
        down the framework first is useful, but I often don't feel fully
        confident until I actually start writing bits of code.
      </p>
      <h3>Trying Something</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 9/10</i></p>
      <p>
        Often the best way forward is just to try an idea and see what happens.
        I usually find that I know more than I thought once I give it a go.
        Trial and error is important, especially when problems first feel
        overwhelming.
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 10/10</i></p>
      <p>
        The rubber ducky method is my favourite. When I'm stuck, I explain the
        problem out loud-sometimes even just to myself. Talking it through helps
        organise my thoughts and often leads me to the solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 5/10</i></p>
      <p>
        Error messages can be very useful for pointing me in the right
        direction, but they also confuse me quite often. They help highlight the
        part of the code that needs attention, but I don't always understand
        exactly what they mean.
      </p>
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 8/10</i></p>
      <p>
        Console.log helps me check what a variable is doing in my code. It's
        useful for seeing the current value or behaviour, but it still throws me
        off sometimes-especially when I get undefined or something unexpected.
      </p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 8/10</i></p>
      <p>
        Searching online with keywords helps me solve different parts of a
        problem. The tricky part is not always knowing what to search for if I
        don't know the thing exists. I usually try changing keywords or
        scrolling through examples until I find something that helps.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking peers for help</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 9/10</i></p>
      <p>
        When I get stuck, I often ask my partner for help. I do my best to solve
        it first, but I also know it's better to ask before I get too
        frustrated. Peers are helpful because they've likely faced the same
        challenges during their learning.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 5/10</i></p>
      <p>
        Asking coaches for help is harder for me. Even though I know they're
        there to support my learning, I usually try every other method before
        asking. Part of this comes from shyness, pride, or not wanting to sound
        silly. But if I really need to, I will ask.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving my process with reflection</h3>
      <p class="red"><i>Confidence: 7/10</i></p>
      <p>
        After finishing code, I like to review it to make sure I really
        understand how everything fits together. Sometimes I need to rewrite
        sections multiple times before it works properly. Reflecting on my code
        helps reinforce what I've learned.
      </p>

      <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      <p><i>What was the problem?</i></p>
      <p>
        I got stuck in Super FlipFlop. I didn't understand how to use a function
        written elsewhere inside another function. The function only returned
        one answer from the array instead of the whole set.
      </p>
      <p><i>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</i></p>
      <p>
        I used Google, rubber ducking, and pseudocode. Talking through the code
        helped me realise I was missing a return. I also learned I needed to use
        let to store results in a new array. Later, I refactored and cleaned up
        extra code.
      </p>
      <p><i>How did you feel throughout the process?</i></p>
      <p>
        I felt confused and a bit frustrated, especially because I thought I had
        solved it but kept hitting the same issue. Once I realised my mistake, I
        felt relieved but also a little silly for forgetting the return.
      </p>
      <p><i>What did you learn?</i></p>
      <p>
        I learned the importance of reading the question carefully and making
        sure I return the correct value. I also learned that pseudocoding can
        help me organise my steps, even if it feels uncertain at first, and that
        refactoring can simplify my code.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
      <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
      <p><i>What was the problem?</i></p>
      <p>I wrote a function to calculate the average of an array of numbers.</p>
      <p><i>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</i></p>
      <p>
        I used what I had already learned: declaring variables, looping, summing
        values, and dividing for the average. I didn't need to Google anything.
      </p>
      <p><i>How did you feel throughout the process?</i></p>
      <p>
        I felt confident and pleasantly surprised that I could solve it without
        outside help. It showed me that my practice was paying off.
      </p>

      <p><i>What did you learn?</i></p>
      <p>
        I learned that I am starting to memorise and apply common coding
        patterns. This gave me confidence that my learning is sticking.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
      <h3>Reluctant to ask for help</h3>
      <p><i>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help.</i></p>
      <p>
        I was reluctant to ask for help when I was close to solving a piece of
        code on my own. I wanted the pride of finishing it solo.
      </p>
      <p><i>What made you reluctant to do so?</i></p>
      <p>
        I didn't want to admit defeat, so I kept pushing even when I was stuck
        for too long.
      </p>
      <p><i>What might you try differently next time?</i></p>
      <p>
        Next time, I'll ask for help sooner instead of being stubborn. This will
        save time, reduce frustration, and give me more space to reflect on the
        solution and learn from it.
